# HerShield - Women Security and Safety Application 


## Introduction  

*HerShield* is a women-centric safety application designed to provide quick assistance in emergencies by leveraging the power of community and technology. Built as part of the *Parul University Hackathon*, HerShield bridges the gap between individuals in distress and their immediate surroundings, ensuring safety and support when it’s needed the most.  

Our mission is to create a secure environment where women feel empowered to live freely and fearlessly. With HerShield, help is just a button away, whether it’s from trusted contacts, bystanders, or authorities.  

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for the HerShield application. Together, we can make safety accessible and reliable for everyone.  

## Let’s build a safer tomorrow with HerShield!
